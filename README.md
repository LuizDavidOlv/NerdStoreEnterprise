## Architecture Overview

### The entire application is based in an unique solution with 7 API's and one web application (MVC)

This is a reference application, each microservice has its own database and represents a bounded context (DDD concept).
There is a BFF / API Gateway to manage the Basket / Order / Payment requests and data structure from responses.

## Getting Started
You can run the DevStore project on any operating system. **Make sure you have installed docker in your environment.** ([Get Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

Clone DevStore repository and navigate to the **/Docker** folder and then:

### If you just want run the DevStore application in your Docker enviroment:

```
docker-compose -f nerdstore_production.yml up
```

### If you want to build the local images and run the DevStore application in your Docker enviroment:

This compose will provide one database container each API service.

```
docker-compose -f nerdstore_production.yml up --build
```
---

### If you want run locally with VS/VS Code:

You will need:

- Docker
- SQL instance (or container)
- Kafka

So you can edit the Docker compose to just run the database and queue dependencies and save your time.

### If you want Visual Studio with F5 and debug experience:

- You will need at least Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.
- The latest SDK and tools can be downloaded from https://dot.net/core
- Setup the solution to start multiple projects and hit F5
